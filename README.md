# spam-detection
SMS Spam detection using logistic regression. In this project I've applied text data preprocessing techniques and tf-idf statistic from scratch to develop a spam classifier.
### Data set
<https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset>

### Steps involved:
    1.Download and pre-process the SMS Spam Collection v.1 dataset.
    2.Test and find best approach (word count or tf-idf vectorizer) to classify the messages.
    3.Selection of approach and splitting the dataset into training and testing data.
    4.Initialize various classifier and train it.
    5.Evaluate the classifiers and finding best the model for a dataset.
